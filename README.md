The dataset contains information on road accidents in Ireland, including the number of accidents, the number of vehicles involved, the type of vehicles, and the time and location of the accidents.

# Tools Used

The following tools were used for this project:

1. Python
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. pandas - for data manipulation and analysis
4. matplotlib - for data visualization

# Files

The files in this project include:

1. data.csv - the original dataset
2. data_clean.csv - a cleaned version of the dataset, used for data analysis
3. Data Visualization.ipynb - the Jupyter Notebook used for data analysis and visualization
4. README.md - this file

# Data Cleaning
The original dataset was cleaned by removing unnecessary columns and filtering out any rows with missing data. The cleaned dataset was then exported to data_clean.csv.

# Data Analysis and Visualization
The cleaned dataset was then analyzed and visualized using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The following analyses were carried out:

- Number of accidents by year
- Number of accidents by month
- Number of accidents by time of day
- Number of accidents by county
- Number of accidents by road type
- Number of accidents by weather conditions
- Number of accidents by road surface conditions
- Number of accidents by vehicle type

The data was visualized using various types of graphs, including bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots. The visualizations help to highlight trends and patterns in the data, and provide useful insights for road safety in Ireland.

# Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into road safety in Ireland, and demonstrates the power of data analysis and visualization in understanding complex datasets. The Jupyter Notebook contains detailed explanations of the code used for each analysis, making it a useful resource for anyone interested in learning more about data analysis and visualization in Python.
